Simple Shell

* Shellinator is a simple command interpreter written in C. It allows users to execute operating system commands in a similar way as they would in a terminal.

 * Features:
- Execution of operating system commands
- Support for built-in commands
- Robust error handling

 * To run our simple shell you must write the " ./hsh " command

* Usage

- To use Shellinator, simply type the command you want to execute in the command line and press Enter. 
If you want to exit Shellinator, simply type the exit command and press Enter or you can press Ctrl+d
[ exit ]

* Built-in commands

Shellinator also includes some built-in commands that you can use. These commands are not executed through the operating system, but are handled directly by Shellinator. The available built-in commands are:

[ exit ]: Exits Shellinator.

How does it works:

## shell.h 
Contain the functions and structures for our program

## sifn.c  
Handle the signs entered

## config.c
Charge the configuration files for the principal bucle

##  divide.c  
Divide the line into tokens

##  execute_command.c

##  Manage the program
